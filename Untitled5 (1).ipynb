    "\n",
    "Euclidean Distance:\n",
    "- Formula: d(p,q)=root semation (i= 1 to n) (Qi -Pi)^2\n",
    "- Calculation: It measures the straight-line distance between two points in Euclidean space.\n",
    "- Interpretation: Represents the length of the shortest path between two points in a geometric space.\n",
    "- Sensitivity: Euclidean distance considers both the magnitude and direction of differences in coordinates, including diagonal movements.\n",
    "- Example: Imagine two points in a 2D plane; Euclidean distance represents the length of the straight line connecting these two points.\n",
    "\n",
    "Manhattan Distance:\n",
    "- Formula:d(p,q)=semation (i= 1 to n) |Qi - Pi|\n",
    "- Calculation: It measures the distance between two points by summing the absolute differences of their coordinates along each dimension.\n",
    "- Interpretation: Represents the distance a taxicab would travel in a city grid system to reach from one point to another, moving horizontally and vertically but not diagonally.\n",
    "- Sensitivity: Manhattan distance only considers horizontal and vertical movements, making it sensitive to differences along each axis independently.\n",
    "- Example: Imagine two points in a 2D plane; Manhattan distance represents the distance traveled along the grid lines (horizontal and vertical) to reach from one point to another.\n",
    "\n",
    "Impact on KNN Performance:\n",
    "- Sensitivity to Features: Euclidean distance considers both magnitude and direction, including diagonal movements, while Manhattan distance only considers horizontal and vertical movements. This difference in sensitivity to features can affect the performance of a KNN classifier or regressor depending on the dataset characteristics. For example, if the dataset contains features that have different scales or contribute differently to the prediction, choosing an appropriate distance metric can lead to better performance.\n",
    "- Curse of Dimensionality: Euclidean distance tends to be more affected by the curse of dimensionality than Manhattan distance. In high-dimensional spaces, where the distances between data points become less meaningful due to the sparsity of data, Manhattan distance may perform better as it focuses on individual dimensions independently and is less sensitive to the overall magnitude of differences.\n",
    "- Robustness to Outliers: Manhattan distance may be more robust to outliers since it calculates distances based on absolute differences rather than squared differences like Euclidean distance. This can prevent outliers from disproportionately influencing the distance calculations and affecting the performance of the KNN algorithm."

Removing irrelevant or redundant features can help reduce the computational complexity of the KNN algorithm and improve performance.\n",
